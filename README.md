# Dialogue & Inventory System
Assets one might find handy for creating an adventure game, but may work with games in need of contained assets in general.

Both the dialogue system and the inventory system is heavily inspired by, but by no means meant to replicate, those seen in the Ace Attorney series.

# Dialogue System
The scrolling text, potentially accompanied by a continuous sound effect, makes the simple text displayed far more engaging compared to if all the text was simply instantaneously displayed on the screen. Furthermore, the scrolling text, with pauses to the scrolling at given punctuation marks, adds a sense of rhythm to the text. It makes it "sound" more like the text is actually being spoken at the time of scrolling, which is exactly what we want for our dialogue. The pause should also be dependent on the punctuation mark: a full stop for example, should cause a longer pause than a comma.
